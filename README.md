# Third-Party-API

## Description

This project is for anyone who wants to stay more organized throughout their work day. It is a virtual planner, that is color coded by hours of the day and changes as the hours go on. This project was built mostly with javascript and jQuery. While working on this project I learned the importance of jQuery and how it is more dynamic than just regular vanilla javascript. I also learned more about local storage and how it is able to save users data even if the close out of the page. 


## Installation

## Usage

To use this web application is actually quite simple. Just navigate to the website and you will see the Title of the page and current date. Then below you can see the 9 hour work day, depending on the time of day it will either show the bubbles grey(if the time has past), red(current time), or green(future time). You can then just click on any hour of the day and type what it is that you need to do; when done just press the save button to the right with the icon on it and it will save your list so you can exit out the page and come see it again later on in the day.
